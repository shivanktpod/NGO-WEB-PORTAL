AADISHRI's main motive is to educate the underprivileged children of slum area. 
Not only education we desire to improve their lifestyle which is trapped<br> in the poverty in the worst way it can. 

AADISHRI Foundation plays an important role in nurturing the children of slum 
area by providing them primary education and basic values of life. 

Our first visit of team Aadishri attracted us towards the slum area
near Gau Ghat, Old Yamuna Bridge, PRAYAGRAJ.

The visit was conducted by almost 15-18 members of Aadishri foundation 
under the guidance of Mr. Bhanu and Mr. Ajeet , 
Faculty of CSE dept. And Applied Science dept. UCER, PRAYAGRAJ respectively.

The different members had different opinion, some observed the flows while 
others enjoyed the beauty of their smile.... 
Some of the members had their eyes wet while 
others experienced happiness on serving them for the first time. 

On interviewing some of the members of AADISHRI, 
we got to know that some of the children were not medically fit 
and even one of them had some ear disease which was not showing any improvement 
even after consulting to some nearby doctors since 1 year.
