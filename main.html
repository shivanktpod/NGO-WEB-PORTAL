Welcome to Aadishri

An NGO [Non Governmental Organization]

Registered by Government Under Society Registration Act 21,1860, Registration Number [ALL/10360/2018-2019] run by group of socially active, determined & educated youths, aims to educate underprivileged children.

 We are here with a thought: “Why only we? Why not the children living in slums have an access to quality education?” Neither we nor they chose the families we are born and also there is no such right that bestows the blessing of education upon us… only us. Every time we think of these children, a question arises in our mind- “What if all these facilities & luxury, which we are enjoying, weren’t available to us?” AADISHRI FOUNDATION has been started to provide quality education to underprivileged children.

We have been working for children living in slums since 2019 and have started working under the name “AADISHRI FOUNDATION” since January 19th , 2019. 

‘AADISHRI FOUNDATION’ means “ALL ABOUT DEVELOPMENT ” and the tag line “ ।। शिक्षा स्वाभिमान सशक्तिकरण ।। ” 
clearly shows our vision for the future guided by the motto EDUCATE * PRIDE * EMPOWERMENT All the members, close to 200 of our organization are committed for the welfare of these underprivileged children. We had initiated our work by teaching about 25 children on daily basis at a slum at GAU GHAT and about 150 children in Newada Samogar area. 

Currently, we are teaching around 150-250 children daily at 2 different locations in NAINI, Prayagraj & Newada Samogar near United College of Engineering and Research in collaboration with our colleagues from various institutions & different section of society. Apart from teaching, a number of events, on the occasions of National Festivals, Major Festivals, Children’s Day, Teacher’s Day, Environment Day etc. are also conducted by our team so that to enhance their knowledge & spread happiness in their life. 

Since the financial condition of these children & their families are not good, they don’t have sufficient clothes to cover their bodies against the odds of nature. In this respect, at regular intervals we distribute clothes among these children and their families. We also organize Award ceremony for our children who performed well in their respective classes named ‘Pratibha Samman Samaroh’ where we honour young talents. We organise Sports fest for our Children Badminton, Kho-Kho, Athletics, Carrom, Chess and etc. To aware them about importance of sports in life. Also, We are running Aadishri foundation Program in order to enhance basic general skills & knowledge about society & surrounding so that children keep learning & growing. We are also preparing our children for some prestigious institutions like JNVS & other central Schools and against this we are receiving a very positive response from our Children.</p>
